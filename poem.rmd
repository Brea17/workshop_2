Helen, thy beauty is to me   
   Like those Nic√©an barks of yore,   
That gently, o'er a perfumed sea,   
   The weary, way-worn wanderer bore   
   To his own native shore.   
  
On desperate seas long wont to roam,   
   Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,   
Thy Naiad airs have brought me home   
   To the glory that was Greece,         
   And the grandeur that was Rome.   
  
Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche   
   How statue-like I see thee stand,   
The agate lamp within thy hand!   
   Ah, Psyche, from the regions which   
   Are Holy-Land!
